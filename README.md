# Assignment

For this exercise, you will build an express.js application that validates a resource and then add tests to the application.

Getting started
You will be adding validation to an application that stores one resource, books. Here is an example of what a book object should look like:{
"isbn": "0691161518",
"amazon_url": "http://a.co/eobPtX2",
"author": "Matthew Lane",
"language": "english",
"pages": 264,
"publisher": "Princeton University Press",
"title": "Power-Up: Unlocking the Hidden Mathematics in Video Games",
"year": 2017
}

# Part One - Getting Started + Adding Validation

Before you get started, read through the code to make sure you understand what’s going on here.

Create your database and then run the data.sql file. You can find the database name in the config.js file.

Use JSONSchema to validate the creation and updating of your books! Display an error message containing all of the validation errors if book creation or updating fails.

# Part Two - Add Tests

Add integration tests for each of your routes to make sure that the response expected is sent.

Think about certain edge cases for each of these routes and add tests for things like invalid input to make sure your schema validation is correct.

Also make sure to set process.env.NODE_ENV = “test” inside of your test file.
